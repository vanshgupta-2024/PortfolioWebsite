     <div class="AboutMe">
    
       Hey there, I'm an undergraduate 1st year student at NSUT, Delhi. I'm fascinated by technology and games. Like, it's such a large domain, we can't possibly know it all...right?  <br>
        Coding is my passion, and I have a lot to learn. 
        In my free time, I usually play video games, scroll through youtube searching for some science related videos or just binge watch anything which I feel is good. <br> I feel that coding helps me to express myself. It is my outlet into the creative world and possibly a path to create a mark upon it.
